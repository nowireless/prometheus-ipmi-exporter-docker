# Configuration file for ipmi_exporter

# This is an example config for scraping remote hosts via IPMI.
# Information required to access remote IPMI interfaces can be supplied in the
# 'modules' section. A scrape can request the usage of a given config by
# setting the `module` URL parameter.

modules:
  default:
          # These settings are used if no module is specified, the
          # specified module doesn't exist, or of course if
          # module=default is specified.
          user: "ADMIN"
          pass: "ADMIN"
          # The below settings correspond to driver-type, privilege-level, and
          # session-timeout respectively, see `man 5 freeipmi.conf` (and e.g.
          # `man 8 ipmi-sensors` for a list of driver types).
          driver: "LAN_2_0"
          privilege: "admin"
          # The session timeout is in milliseconds. Note that a scrape can take up
          # to (session-timeout * #-of-collectors) milliseconds, so set the scrape
          # timeout in Prometheus accordingly.
          timeout: 10000
          # Available collectors are bmc, ipmi, chassis, dcmi, sel, and sm-lan-mode
          # If _not_ specified, bmc, ipmi, chassis, and dcmi are used
          collectors:
          - bmc
          - ipmi
          - chassis
          - dcmi
          - sel
          - sm-lan-mode
